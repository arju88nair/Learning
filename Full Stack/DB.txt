Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite3 represent and store data in tables and rows. 

They're based on a branch of algebraic set theory known as relational algebra.

The Mongo import utility can import JSON, CSV and TSV file formats.

Mongo query targets of data are technically represented as BSON (binary JASON).

Relational databases use Structured Querying Language (SQL), making them a good choice for applications that involve the management of several 
transactions. 

ACID -  Atomicity (each transaction be "all or nothing"), Consistency (any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another), Isoloation (concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed sequentially), Durability (once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so)

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm



DECODE is a function in Oracle and is used to provide if-then-else type of logic to SQL.


To fetch ALTERNATE records from a table. (EVEN NUMBERED)
select * from emp where rowid in (select decode(mod(rownum,2),0,rowid, null) from emp);

To select ALTERNATE records from a table. (ODD NUMBERED)
select * from emp where rowid in (select decode(mod(rownum,2),0,null ,rowid) from emp);

Find the 3rd MAX salary in the emp table.
select distinct sal from emp e1 where 3 = (select count(distinct sal) from emp e2 where e1.sal <= e2.sal);

Alter table table_name add(columnname1 datatype(size), columname2 datatype(size),....);

Alter table table_name modify(columnname1 datatype(size), columnname2 datatype(size),....);

Truncate table command it is used to delete all rows permanently from the table.

Insert into table_name values(values1, value2, value3,……);
