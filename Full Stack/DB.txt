Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite3 represent and store data in tables and rows. 

They're based on a branch of algebraic set theory known as relational algebra.

The Mongo import utility can import JSON, CSV and TSV file formats.

Mongo query targets of data are technically represented as BSON (binary JASON).

Relational databases use Structured Querying Language (SQL), making them a good choice for applications that involve the management of several 
transactions. 

ACID -  Atomicity (each transaction be "all or nothing"), Consistency (any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another), Isoloation (concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed sequentially), Durability (once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so)

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm
