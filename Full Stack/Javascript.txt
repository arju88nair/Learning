Callback functions
-------------------

They are derived from a programming paradigm known as functional programmings

A callback function, also known as a higher-order function, is a function that is passed to another function
Eg:

$("#btn_1").click(function() {
  alert("Btn 1 Clicked");
});



Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects

A pure function is a function which:
Given the same inputs, always returns the same output, and
Has no side-effects


Shared state is any variable, object, or memory space that exists in a shared scope, or as the property of an object being passed between scopes.
