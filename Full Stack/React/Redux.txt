{CreateStore}
Creates a Redux store that holds the state tree. The only way to change the data in the store is to call dispatch() on it.

There should only be a single store in your app. To specify how different parts of the state tree respond to actions, you may combine several reducers into a single reducer function by using combineReducers.
