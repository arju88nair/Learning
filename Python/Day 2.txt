	- For threads with a count of 50000000 it takes 10 secs for example and the same thing without threads take 5 secs
	- As per the talk provided in link , as more the cores are getting used, threads use less time, Go figure!

Python interpretor uses POSIX threads
	- Real threads
	- Windows threads
	- Managed by the host system
	- Interpreter inhibits parallel tasks -for performance 

Advatage of GIL 
	- Co-operative multitasking
	-  A thread runs till you give up,ie,I/o operation.Then another takes the thread

CPU bound tasks never gives up threads
	- Handled as a special case
	- Check takes place every 100 ticks
